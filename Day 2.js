// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

//Task 1: Add two numbers and log the result to the console.


let a = 5;
let b = 10;
console.log("Sum:", a + b);


//Task 2: Subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.


console.log("Difference:", a - b);


//Task 3: Multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.


console.log("Product:", a * b);


//Task 4: Divide two numbers and log the result to the console.


console.log("Quotient:", a / b);


//Task 5: Find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.


console.log("Remainder:", a % b);

// Activity 2: Assignment Operators

//Task 6: Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.


let c = 20;
c += 10;
console.log("c after += 10:", c);


//Task 7: Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.


c -= 5;
console.log("c after -= 5:", c);


// Activity 3: Comparison Operators

//Task 8: Compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.


console.log("a > b:", a > b);
console.log("a < b:", a < b);


//Task 9: Compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.


console.log("a >= b:", a >= b);
console.log("a <= b:", a <= b);


//Task 10:Compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.


console.log("a == b:", a == b);
console.log("a === b:", a === b);


//Activity 4: Logical Operators

//Task 11 Use the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.


let x = true;
let y = false;
console.log("x && y:", x && y);


//Task 12: Use the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.


console.log("x || y:", x || y);


//Task 13: Use the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.


console.log("!x:", !x);


//Activity 5: Ternary Operator

//Task 14: Use the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.


let number = -10;
let result = (number >= 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative";
console.log("The number is:", result);
